# piring v2
- Using the touchscreen interface instead of the single button.
- The touchscreen interface is hackable, but not easily customizable. Now has:
	* 1:Announcement 2:Lockdown 3:Fire alarm 4:Earthquake (0:off)
  * There are no more flexibly configurable alarm options.
- Switching to sox for better sound file format support.
- The previous piring v1 is on git branch v1.
